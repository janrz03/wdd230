            <p>Hello! My name is Jamner Ruiz, and I am from Panama city in Central America, I enjoy watching series and movies also to run and make some exercise to feel healthy and young. I am a Technical support engineer, I completed a Bachelor in Engineering of Electronics and communications, but actually I am working as a System Engineer because I handle Linux OS, CLI, servers, hardware and all the stuffs related with enterprise environments, the best part of my job is the opportunity to see different issues every day and have the chance to get more knowledge. I have to read new documentations and be familiarized with virtualization environment for management and also the hardware for servers; For my is great to have new things to see and resolve every day and this is one of the reason, why I want to learn more about coding and development due to since I start working with CLI and use some python scripts to resolve bugs in the management virtual machines</p>

          <p>Panama City is the most cosmopolitan capital in Central America, and a must-visit for any traveler in the area. The capital of Panam√° is actually 3 cities in one, with a historic district, a rebuilt district, and very modern areas. This vibrant and dynamic urban center is truly a cosmopolitan city in the middle of the tropics, so expect to see massive skyscrapers surrounded by breathtaking nature. A country for those who seek beyond expectations, that dares you to see more. Taste more. Connect more. Feel more. A place for those who long more stimulation, connection and transformation. Panam√° is not the destination, but the journey to discover more of what truly matters.</p>
